The Challenge
In this problem, we have provided information about various internships posted on Internshala. This includes various attributes about the internships like location, duration, start_date of internship etc. We have also provided information about the students who have applied for the internship. These include type_of_institute, current_year, academic performance of the student etc. Any student is free to apply for any internship on the portal.

While employers get high response to their posting, it is difficult to go through a high number of applications for the employers. They might need to go through high number of applications to shortlist the most relevant candidates. Hence an intelligent matching algorithm can help our users get better experience and enhance chances ofmeaningful profile matches.
